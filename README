WWW::Search::Scraper
WWW::Search::Sherlock
WWW::Search::Scraper::*
WWW::SearchResult::*

These modules scrape data from search engines on the WWW (much like Apple's 
Sherlock, but these are more capable, complete, and accurate.) Complete
documentation can be found in WWW::Search::Scraper and WWW::Search::Sherlock.

Special options for each type of search engine are documented in their respective modules.

Examples include:

1. SearchApartments - illustrates how to easily set up and use one search engine.
2. Sherlock    - illustrates the ease of adapting any Sherlock plugin.
3. Scraper     - illustrates how SearchResult sub-classing can be used to build
                 a more generalized search engine scraper. You can see how this
		 can be extended to build a multi-engine scraper.
		 

If you want to write new Scraper modules to access new search engines, see
FlipDog.pm for the current "best practices".

Happy Hunting!

( $VERSION ) = sprintf("%d.%02d", q$Revision: 1.38 $ =~ /(\d+)\.(\d+)/)

v1.38 - Fix itsy-bitsy boo-boo in Scraper.pm (was not escaping input strings).
        Improved documentation in several of the modules.
	Added Scraper::Request module for later abstraction of "requests".
	Added Brainpower.com.
v1.37 - Moved Sherlock.pm to WWW::Search::Scraper to avoid namespace collision.
        Improved some of the documentation layout (I think).
v1.36 - Added test.pl; fixed bugs discovered thereby in Dice, apartments, eBay, etc.
v1.35 - Added FlipDog.com, and a few features to Scraper.pm (e.g. 'BOGUS', etc).
v1.34 - Introduced SearchResult sub-classing, with illustration in eg/Scraper.pl
        Improved reliability of BAJobs.pm
        Dice.com changed the result page format, again. I hope this version
          of Dice.pm will be more adaptive to Dice.com's future changes.
        Added www.computerjobs.com and www.techies.com (which still has a problem)
	Added examples: eg/SearchApartments, improved eg/Scraper.
v1.33 - Added www.apartments.com, and eg/Sherlock.pl

KNOWN PROBLEMS

theWorksUSA.pm more often than not goes into a loop.
techies.pm keeps saying "Please enable your cookies", so it doesn't work at all.
