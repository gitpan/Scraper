
Revision history for WWW::Search::Scraper (::*).

v2.12 - HotJobs.pm is not working in this version, so we've put it on leave . . .
	Make dependant on Tie::Persistent - rt.cpan.org: Ticket #74
	Try to be nice to Google.com via LWP::RobotUA.
	Improvements in handling "native_query" vs "Request" object.
v2.10 - Improved Google.pm: added "category", "categoryURL", "similarPagesURL",
	and "sampleText".
v2.01 - Clarify conflicts between Request's canonical query, WWW::Search's
	(and ::Scraper's) native query and options, and each module's
	default options. This greatly simplifies the design and usage.
	Fixed some problems with Brainpower's details page.
v2.00 - Complete Request/Response classification framework.
v1.39 - Added 'ResultType' parameter to HIT*. Complete refurbishment of Response
        generation, old SearchResult type is now a simple sub-type of Response.
	You may override this with a 'scraperResultType' option on Scraper->new(),
	or better, in the 'HIT*' element of the Scraper module's scraperFrame.
	Also completely refurbished the Request end - old style is now a 
	simple sub-type of Request (auto-converted within Scraper.pm).
	Added Request::Job.pm.
	The most mature search engine is now Brainpower.pm. It uses Request::Job
	properly, in the 'HIT*' element of its scraperFrame.
v1.38 - Fix itsy-bitsy boo-boo in Scraper.pm (was not escaping input strings).
        Improved documentation in several of the modules.
	Added Scraper::Request module for later abstraction of "requests".
	Added Brainpower.com.
v1.37 - Moved Sherlock.pm to WWW::Search::Scraper to avoid namespace collision.
        Improved some of the documentation layout (I think).
v1.36 - Added test.pl; fixed bugs discovered thereby in Dice, apartments, eBay, etc.
v1.35 - Added FlipDog.com, and a few features to Scraper.pm (e.g. 'BOGUS', etc).
v1.34 - Introduced SearchResult sub-classing, with illustration in eg/Scraper.pl
        Improved reliability of BAJobs.pm
        Dice.com changed the result page format, again. I hope this version
          of Dice.pm will be more adaptive to Dice.com's future changes.
        Added www.computerjobs.com and www.techies.com (which still has a problem)
	Added examples: eg/SearchApartments, improved eg/Scraper.
v1.33 - Added www.apartments.com, and eg/Sherlock.pl
