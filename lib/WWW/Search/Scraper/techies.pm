=head1 NAME

WWW::Search::Scraper::techies - Scrapes www.techies.com


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    require WWW::Search::Scraper;
    $search = new WWW::Search::Scraper('techies');

Unfortunately, this one does not work. I've included it here in the hope
that somebody can figure it out, since I can't.

It seems no matter what I do, techies.com responds with a demand that I
"enable cookies on your browser". I'm sure cookies are enabled via Search.pm
for techies.pm, so there's something fishy going on with this that I can't figure out.
