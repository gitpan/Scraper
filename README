WWW::Search::Scraper
WWW::Search::Sherlock
WWW::Search::Scraper::*
WWW::SearchResult::*

These modules scrape data from search engines on the WWW (much like Apple's 
Sherlock, but these are more capable and accurate.) Complete documentation can
be found in WWW::Search::Scraper and WWW::Search::Sherlock.

Special options for each type of search engine are documented in their respective modules.

Examples include:

1. SearchApartments - illustrates how to easily set up and use one search engine.
2. Sherlock    - illustrates the ease of adapting any Sherlock plugin.
3. Scraper     - illustrates how SearchResult sub-classing can be used to build
                 a more generalized search engine scraper. You can see how this
		 can be extended to build a multi-engine scraper.
		 

Happy Hunting!

( $VERSION ) = sprintf("%d.%02d", q$Revision: 1.34 $ =~ /(\d+)\.(\d+)/)

v1.34 - Introduced SearchResult sub-classing, with illustration in eg/Scraper.pl
        Improved reliability of BAJobs.pm
        Dice.com changed the result page format, again. I hope this version
          of Dice.pm will be more adaptive to Dice.com's future changes.

	Added examples: eg/SearchApartments, improved eg/Scraper.
