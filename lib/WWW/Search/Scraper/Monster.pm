 use WWW::Search;
 my $oSearch = new WWW::Search('Monster');
 my $sQuery = WWW::Search::escape_query("unix and (c++ or java)");
 $oSearch->native_query($sQuery,
 			{'st' => 'CA',
			 'tm' => '14d'});
 while (my $res = $oSearch->next_result()) {
     print $res->company . "\t" . $res->title . "\t" . $res->change_date
	 . "\t" . $res->location . "\t" . $res->url . "\n";
 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

description of the query language.

The returned WWW::Search::Response objects contain B<url>, B<title>, B<company>,
B<location> and B<change_date> fields.

=head1 OPTIONS 

The following search options can be activated by sending
a hash as the second argument to native_query().
